Split Sample
}
\description{
  This is a fast implementation of the pivotal method.
}
\usage{

  split_sample(
     prob,
     delta  = exp(-16)
     ) 
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{prob}{
    An array of length N such that the sum of prob is equal to the sample size,
    where the N is the number of rows of \code{x}.
  }
  \item{delta}{
    A small real value that is used for tolerance in determining if the value is
    included or excluded from the sample.
  }
}
\value{ 
  An array of indexes from prob.  Indexes with this list are sampled.
