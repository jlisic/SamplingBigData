Title: Balanced and Spatially Balanced Sampling for Big Data

Author: Jonathan Lisic, Anton Grafstr√∂m

Maintainer: Jonathan Lisic <jlisic@gmail.com>

Description: 
Description: Select sampling methods for probability samples using large data sets.  This includes spatially balanced sampling in multi-dimensional spaces with any prescribed inclusion probabilities. All implementations are written in C with efficient data structures such as k-d trees that easily scale to several million rows on a modern desktop computer.
